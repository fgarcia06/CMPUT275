Included Files:
	sales.cpp
	README

Running Instructions:

	In the directory containing the files sales.cpp, use the command "g++ -o <name_of_choice> sales.cpp" to compile and link the .cpp file. Afterwards, run "./<name_of_choice>". 

Notes and Assumptions: 
	The first line of input will be of the form "n T", where n is the number of prices and T being the target price (following the constraints below), the second line of input is 'n' spaced integers that are distinct and satisfy: 0 <= p1 < ... < p2 <= 10^9.

	- n must have a range of 2 <= n <= 250,000.
	- T must have a range 0 <= T <= 2*10^9.
