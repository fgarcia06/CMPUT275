Weekly Exercise 3: Reference_Manager

Included Files:
	ref_manager.cpp
	ref_manager.h
	we3_test.cpp
	README
	Makefile

Running Instructions:

	In the directory containing the files ref_manager.cpp, ref_manager.h, we3_test.cpp, use the command "g++ -o <name_of_choice> ref_manager.cpp ref_manager.h we3_test.cpp" to compile and link the .cpp file. Afterwards, run "./<name_of_choice>". 

Notes and Assumptions: 
	There are 5 following queries that can be used when the executable file has been executed:
		
		- c p n str
			this query allocates memory for a new string, p and n are both integers (1 <= p <= 100), where p being the index of the pointer, and n being the length of string, str is the string being stored.

		- s p1 p2 
			causes pointer p1 to reference what is referenced to by p2

		- q p
			print the string that is referenced to by p, or NULL if p is not currently referencing a string

		- q
			causes garbage collection to start, any strings in the garbage array must be deallocated using delete

		-e 
			exit the program
