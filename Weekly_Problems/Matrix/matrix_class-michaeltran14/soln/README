Weekly Exercise 5: Matrix Class

Included Files:
	matrix.cpp
	matrix.h
	we5_test.cpp
	README
	Makefile

Running Instructions:

	In the directory containing the files we5_test.cpp, matrix.cpp, and matrix.h, use the command "g++ -o <name_of_choice> we5_test.cpp matrix.cpp matrix.h" to compile and link the .cpp files. Afterwards, run "./<name_of_choice>".  

Notes and Assumptions: 
	These are the following queries that can be used when the executable file has been executed:
		
		- C mat name rows columns (-c) -i init
			Create a new matrix by calling the parametrized constructor. (Matrix mat_name = Matrix(rows, columns, init))
				If the -c flag is added before -i, a const matrix will be created as a const matrix.

		- C mat name rows columns (-c) -a init1 init2 · · · init_rows×columns
			Create a new matrix by calling the parametrized constructor. (Matrix mat_name = Matrix(rows, columns, arr_ptr))
				arr_ptr contains the initial values, if -c flag is added before -a, const matrix is made.

	The following 3 queries are made with the assumption that the matrices are of correct sizes:

		- A my_matrix1 my_matrix2 result
			Add two matrices using operator+ and store the result in a new matrix called result.

		- S my_matrix1 my_matrix2 result
			Subtract two matrices using operator- and store the result in a new matrix called result.

		- M my_matrix1 my_matrix2 result 
			Multiply two matrices using operator* and store the result in a new matrix called result.

		- N my_matrix result
			Negate the matrix using unary minus operator, stores in new matrix called matrix.

		- T my_matrix result
			Transpose the matrix, store the result in new matrix called matrix.

		- B my_matrix row column
			This command will return a specific element of a const or non-const matrix.

		- BA my_matrix row column value
			This command will assign a value to a specific element of a non-const matrix.

		- P my_matrix
			Prints my_matrix.

		- R my_matrix val1 val2 ... val_rows×columns
			Read rows×columns floating point numbers from stdin using the extraction operator and loads them into the non-const matrix

		- D my_matrix new_matrix
			This command will create a new matrix and initialize it using the given matrix. The copy constructor will be called as a result of running this command.

		- Q
			Terminates the execution of the driver.
