Weekly Exercise 4: Dynamic Array

Included Files:
	hash_table.h
	linkedlist.h
	dynarray.h
	we4_test.cpp
	README

Running Instructions:

	In the directory containing the files we4_test.cpp, hash_table.h, linkedlist.h, and we4_test.cpp, use the command "g++ -o <name_of_choice> we4_test.cpp" to compile and link the .cpp file. Afterwards, run "./<name_of_choice>".  

Notes and Assumptions: 
	There are 6 following queries that can be used when the executable file has been executed:
		
		- I e
			This command will insert a new element, an unsigned integer e, in the table. This will happen only if this element is not in the table.

		- R e 
			This command will insert an element, an unsigned integer e, from the table. We promise we will not test this command to remove something that is not in the table.

		- Q e
			This command will look up an unsigned integer e, in the table and retunr either "found" or "not found".

		- B
			This command will return the current size of the table, i.e., the number of buckets that constitute the table.

		- S
			This command will return the number of elements that are currently in the table.

		- STOP
			This command will terminate the execution of the driver.
